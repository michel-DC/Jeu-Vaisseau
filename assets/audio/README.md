Place your sound effect files here with the following names (used by the client):

- laser-weak.mp3      (played when attack damage <= 100)
- laser-strong.mp3    (played when attack damage > 100)
- drone-attack.mp3    (played when launching an attack drone)
- drone-recon.mp3     (played when launching a reconnaissance drone)
- move.mp3            (played when moving the ship)
- recharge.mp3        (played when using the Recharger action)
- magic.mp3           (played when using magic)
- error.mp3           (played on network/API errors)

These files are not included in the repo by default. Add your own .mp3 files or update the filenames in `scripts/game.js` to match your assets.
